ASTRA â€“ Automated Satellite Threshold Reporting &amp; Alerts

1. Purpose
To build a scalable and configurable web application that monitors MATLAB-generated metrics for a constellation of 10 satellite payloads. When thresholds are breached, trigger events are recorded and displayed in a web-based dashboard.

2. Problem Statement
Satellite operations teams require an automated system to detect and view threshold breaches across payloads, replacing manual tracking for improved efficiency and visibility.
